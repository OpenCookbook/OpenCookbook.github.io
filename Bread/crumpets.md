# Crumpets

## ingredients 
- 150g plain white flour 
- 200ml water 
- ½ tsp salt 
- ½ tsp sugar 
- 1 tsp baking powder 
- 1 tsp dried yeast 



## Directions
- Add flour, water and salt to a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously for around five minutes.
- Mix a splash of water into to your dried yeast and add sugar, baking powder and the yeast mixture to the bowl and mix for another 30 seconds until you have a clear batter.
- Cover your mixing bowl and put it into a warm place for 15 minutes to settle. Make sure you use a generous sized bowl as the mixture will expand.



## Cooking
- Place a greased metal biscuit cutter (or any shape cutter you have to hand) into the middle of a non-stick frying pan.
- Pre-heat your frying pan on a hob on a medium-high heat setting.
- Give your batter a stir to remove any large air bubbles, then use a ladle to drop approximately 60g of batter into the cutter inside the pan.
- Wait for approximately four minutes, then carefully lift the cutter away from the crumpet. If the top still looks a bit under-baked, flip it over in the pan for a few seconds.
- Remove your baked crumpet from pan and allow it to cool.
- Repeat using up the rest of the batter, then toast them and add your topping before tucking in!
