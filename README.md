# Recipes
I got tired of looking for new recipes online, and having every one I
find come with the life story of the person sharing it. That, and adverts. Tons
of adverts. Simple recipes in text files with simple instructions shouldn't be
that hard. 

I thought treating a cookbook like an open source software project might be a good idea.
This allows people to clone the whole cookbook with `git clone`, or browse them
on the web interface. Adding recipes is possible easily via pull request. k


One thing I would like to keep out of the recipes as much as possible is branding.
When it doesn't matter if you are using King Edgar's Flour, or Land 'O Puddles butter,
leave the brand name out. Sometimes it is necesary. I have a peanut butter fudge
recipe that doesn't set right if you use a certain type of peanut butter. In
that case, it makes sense to include the brand.j




# TODO
- As for now I am just adding some recipes I have saved over the years as text files, but eventually, I would like to go back and add some consistency and formatting.
Perhaps even styling and have it viewable as a static site with jekyll or something.
- Organize recipes by type.
