# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients
- 300g water
- 18g Olive Oil
- 488g bread flour
- 5g salt
- 3g yeast

## Directions
- Use dough setting on bread maker
- when done, cut the dough into whatever size you want
- shape into balls and let them rest covered for 20 minutes. 
- toss/roll/hammer/flatten however you want, then make pizza with them 


### Alternative 1
If you don't have bread flour but do have all purpose flour and gluten, you can
make this with 470g  of all purpose flour and 18g of essential wheat gluten and
it comes out pretty similar.

### Alternative 2
If you only have all purpose flour, but no gluten, just use the full ammount of
flour, but be careful stretching the dough because it will tear more easily.
